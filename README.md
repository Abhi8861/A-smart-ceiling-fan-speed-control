# A-smart-ceiling-fan-speed-control
Ceiling fan speed control using an android phone by modifying existing speed control of ceiling fan.

##Aims Global
-finalize communication technology to be used.
-Bluetooth,Wifi are the 2 best viable technlogy
-Speed control hardware connection to the existing knobs
-Allowing Physical speed change(using knobs) along with Phone controlled speed change independently
-PCB fabrication and wiring for domestic /non commercial use

#Aims-Oct month
-Block Diagram approach
-Simulation of a single phase induction motor speed control 
-Gathering required components
-Working on phone to hardware communication in a Block diagram approach
